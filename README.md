## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+** ([Download](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
- **Java 17+** (Java 24 fully supported) ([Download](https://adoptium.net/))

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DesvoSoft/ZeroBlockBridge.git
    cd ZeroBlockBridge
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**

    Create a virtual environment (recommended):

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

    Install dependencies from the `requirements.txt` file:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Run the application**
    ```bash
    python app/main.py
    ```

### First Server

1.  Click **"Create Server"** in the sidebar.
2.  Follow the 5-step wizard to configure your server.
3.  Select the server from the list.
4.  Click **"Start"**. On the very first run, the server will start, create necessary files, and then you can stop it. On the second start, your settings from the wizard will be applied.
5.  **Optional**: Enable tunneling to play with friends online.

Note: The tunneling feature uses the free third party services from [Playit.GG](http://playit.gg/). The app will lead to their website and the respecitve dashboard to connect the agent, the tunnel, and to confirm your shearable IP (One time process).
